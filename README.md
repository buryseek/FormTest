## Getting started

Create a virtual environment for the project:  
`python3 -m venv virtualenv`

Then activate the virtual environment:  
`source virtualenv/bin/activate`  
Or on Powershell:  
`.\virtualenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

Now install the dependencies for the project:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You should now be able to run the API with:
